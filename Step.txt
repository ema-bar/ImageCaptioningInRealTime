1) If you use the pre-trained model (modelLab190Epoch) then start the "ipcamera_coco.py" file, taking into account that the streaming flow must be set to 30 FPS (there is the appropriate section on ipwebcam).

2) If you want to train another model using the same dataset of images already extracted, then the steps are:
    1: launch the "prepareData.py" file, remember to change the "path" variable. There are numerous comments within the code that describe the code.
    2: start the "trainingModel.py" file, remember to change the name of the model in the ".save()" method to be able to save the model training during the various desired epochs.
    3: Launch the "testModel.py" file on any model that will be saved, remember to change the model name in the ".load_model()" method.
         The best method is the beam_search with k=3, but for 1429 images it requires about 40 minutes (obviously with mediocre hardware specifications), the greedy method instead requires only 15 minutes but is a little less accurate.
    4: finally launch the "ipcamera_coco.py" file to carry out real-time testing.

    If desired, step "3" can be skipped to directly carry out real-time testing.
    During step "1" numerous files will be created in ".p" (pickle) format necessary to be input to step "2" for training and to step "4" for real-time testing.

3) If you want to train another model using a new image dataset before performing option "2" (above), then the steps are:
    1: Launch the "cocodataset.py" file in the "downloadImageFromCoco" folder by choosing the desired labels (the code is commented).
    2: open the "prepareCaptions" folder containing the "StepPostExtraction" text file with the steps to follow to format the data.

Necessary dependencies:
    -pycocotools (extract images from MSCOCO)
    -time (get the times the various scripts take)
    -keras
    -pickle
    -numpy
    -cv2
    -matplotlib
    -nltk
    -skimage (to view images)
    -tqdm
